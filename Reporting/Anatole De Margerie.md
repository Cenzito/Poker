Week 7: Connected two interfaces (homewindow and gamewindow) and resolved some compiling issues. Still struggling with github, so was merged to main by Remy.
Week 8: I was elected leader for UI/visuals. At this point, we are mainly waiting for the logic section to have moved forward in order to implement parametrized visuals, but we designed the home menu with fonts colors and images.
Week 9: I assigned everyone to a role/section now that the logics section has advanced (still several bugs on main branch so we all stuggled to work during the TD session) :
  - Table Cards
  - Player Cards
  - Implementing a possible visual for chip stacks (seems complicated but trying)
      - Player stacks
      - Pot
  - General game appearance, differentiating active and inactive players, displaying player names, etc...
  I personally tried to set a background for the gamewindow but had problems displaying a png image (only worked for jpg), but resolved now. I have started searching for ways to

Week 10:
