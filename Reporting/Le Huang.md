Week 9
My partner implemented the basic server which could make people communicate and I read the documents about SQLite and 
try to implement the account creation by the library <sqlite3.h>.

Eventually, I did not use the SQL to build the account creation. Instead of that, I utilise the struct and class to implement.
The function in class could check if the username exists and if the username and password are correct.
