#Reporting by Diego Munoz

WEEK 1:
Started investigating and learning about different Poker statistics that may be of use, including VPIP and Agression Factor (AF).
Received the Poker games that Mateo and Alvaro played. Looked at the format and started thinking of how processing the data.

WEEK 2:
Created various files for the processing of the data and the calculation of the VPIP and AF. For the first part of processing the file, we had to read the .txt file from PokerStars and make it into the dictionary we had defined as the PokerHands for each player in the functions that I also defined (calculate_vpip and calculate_af), in the other file.
