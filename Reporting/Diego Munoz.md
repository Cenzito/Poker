#Reporting by Diego Munoz

WEEK 1:
Started investigating and learning about different Poker statistics that may be of use, including VPIP and Agression Factor (AF).
Received the Poker games that Mateo and Alvaro played. Looked at the format and started thinking of how processing the data.

WEEK 2:
Created various files for the processing of the data and the calculation of the VPIP and AF. For the first part of processing the file, we had to read the .txt file from PokerStars and make it into the dictionary we had defined as the PokerHands for each player in the functions that I also defined (calculate_vpip and calculate_af), in the other file.


WEEK of (10th January 2024):
Had to start most of the file from scratch because we had a lot of issues between the files and the importations, rewrote the whole file and the data processing function and now it runs smoothly thanks to different prints throughout the function we can see that, now I only have to fix a few errors and we we'll be done with that. Once the processing data function is ready, we'll be able to calculate any important Poker measure we need from players so we can analyze their game.

WEEK of 22th January 2024:

Alongside Alvaro we finished the functions for Agression Factor and VPIP for each player, using his function ReadMargins and ReadHands, and the worked perfectly, now we have to adapt all of our work for QT and then develop a UI so it can be translated into a visual aspect, we'll ask for help to the Visuals group.
