### Role: Project Leader

--------------------------

## Week 1 (27/11 -> 02/12)

First week of actually working on the project. Last week and those before were mostly talking about what we wanted to implement and the goals of the project.  
During the Monday discussion session, I assigned tasks to each team. The objectives of this week will be to have a working Poker game. Meaning we can play against very basic robot players.  
###### Here are the tasks for the different teams: 
  - The team in charge of the UI aspect of the project will create a main menue and the game scene. I divided them in two groups for those two tasks. 
  - The Logic team will need to have finished working on the logic behind the game of Poker and have incorporated it into the app.  
  - The Server team is mostly autonom as their contribution isn't urgent. They are working on creating a working server in order first to play in local on multiple windows and the end goal will be to be able to play online.
  - The Bot team is starting by weak bots and will then work on one "Strong" bot each that we will then make compete against each other at the end. Their progress is really promising and I can't wait to see the end product.
  - One more team was created that will in the future be joined by the Logic team. This team will be called the Analysis team. Their goal is to create a window where we can analyse our Poker games. First we will need a way to save them then replay them. I also want statistics about them such as money gained over time, how much you bet in different positions etc... This feature would be akin to the app PokerTracker albeit less advanced.

After the organisation, I undertook to create the basic layout of the project and understanding how qmake works. I created directories for each part of the project and linked them all together. This gives us a foundation to start building our app. 
I also gave information about the workflow we would adopt and how Github works to those that struggled.

I will regularly be checking the files and commits made to the repository, making sure everything is working.
