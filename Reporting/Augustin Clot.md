Week 1: worked on creating a basic interface with the UI team on qt design.

Week 2: Resolved an issue where the main window wouldn't pop up when running the project. Tried to delay the display of the community cards, but ended up messing around with widgets for 2 hours trying to figure them out.

Week 3: Working on linking check, raise, fold buttons to the logic part of the program.

Week 5: Buttons linked to logic, however need to work on what happens on the other end, and we are now thinking about how to update PokerPlayer or Game through the display.
