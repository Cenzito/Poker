## Week of Monday 20 Nov 2023

1. **Player, Game and Deck Class Architecture:**
   - Worked on the architecture w. comments of `Player`, `Game`, `Deck` classes, outlining ideas for essential functions.
   - The objective is to enable a logical flow for a full game of poker.
  
2. **Implementation Concept:**
   - Envisioned a structured approach:
      - `Game` class manages the game flow, rounds, winner determination, and prize distribution.
      - `Player` class creates player instances, each with chips, the ability to play, and potential user interaction.
      - `Deck` class, focused on card distribution, randomly selects integers (1-52) representing cards.

3. **Next step: Code Implementation:**
  - Translate architectural concepts into code for the `Player`, `Game`, and `Deck` classes.
