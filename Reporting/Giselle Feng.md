Week1: learn the differences between the mainwindow.UI file (where we use design) and other files where you call the functions and program functionalities. The .ui files only
take care of the visual aspect and does not automatically have functionalities embedded to it. 

Week2: Took care of the rules page, but there were a lot of conflicts when merging.
