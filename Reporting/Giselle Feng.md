Week1: Learned the differences between the mainwindow.UI file (where we use design) and other files where you call the functions and program functionalities. The .ui files only take care of the visual aspect and does not automatically have functionalities embedded to it. Familiarized with the basic functionalities of QT deisgn. 

Week2: Took care of the rules page, but there were a lot of conflicts when merging and i worked on a pop up page instead of window that opened when clicked on "page" so we decided in the end to replace it.

Week3:  Worked on the gamewindow page by adding some buttons and defining their functions.

Week4: Tried displaying the game table image on the game window page with Lucas. We cowrked on this assignement with the help of the TA but took us a very long time because the image itself had a problem and we thought it was something wrong with our code. 

Week 5: Worked on displaying the bets and each poker player's name on the game window page. Couldn't use loops as all player infos are saved in a table so had to use several IF statements. 

Week 6: Worked on Maindow expansion so that when we expanded the page, all the buttons and displayed expanded accordingly. Additionally worked on the next round push button. 

Week 7: Took care of displaying the image of cards in the rules page. It took a while for me to realize that i had to edit on the ruleswindow page and not the QT design file because, as we worked on the expansion, everything has to be "copied" onto the ruleswindow.cp page to assure the content expanded accordingly. Finally, imporved the mainwindow page again, especially on the buttons and design.
