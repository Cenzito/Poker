Week1: learn the differences between the mainwindow.UI file (where we use design) and other files where you call the functions and program functionalities. The .ui files only
take care of the visual aspect and does not automatically have functionalities embedded to it. 

Week2: Took care of the rules page, but there were a lot of conflicts when merging.

Week3:  Worked on the gamewindow page by adding some buttons and defining their functions.

Week4: Tried displaying the game table image on the game window page with Lucas, howevery this got overriden so did not appear on the current version. 

Week 5: Worked on displaying the bets and each poker player's name on the game window page. Couldn't use loops as all player infos are saved in a table so had to use several IF statements.
