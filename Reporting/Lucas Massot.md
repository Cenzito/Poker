my changes 

first week : creation of gamewindow on which another member worked, tried to implement the Card class but had issues with github merging that made me lose half of it.

second week : uploaded temporary images of the cards in the resources, creation of test button deal card, the function get_image_path to handle the conversion from a (suit, value) to a url, implemented the label cards in the gamewindow.

third week : got rid of the deal_button that was just meant for testing. Implemented the bet system buttons and a first draft of the raise/bet system on the display side.
