my changes 

first week : creation of gamewindow on which another member worked, tried to implement the Card class but had issues with github merging that made me lose half of it.

second week : uploaded temporary images of the cards in the resources, creation of test button deal card, the function get_image_path to handle the conversion from a (suit, value) to a url, implemented the label cards in the gamewindow.

third week : got rid of the deal_button that was just meant for testing. Implemented the bet system buttons and a first draft of the raise/bet system on the display side.

holidays : took care of merging all the ui branch and unfiy them into single main one, checked and perfected display/ui related functions 

first week back : started working on the expensible window and reworked the whole display with layouts. Recoded display related functions that weren't working, and added functionalities to these displays functions.

second week back : continued the layout display, added cards for the players and a next round button.
