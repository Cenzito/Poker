Week 1 (20.11 - 26.11)
This week I created an outline for the medium bot (decided on what porbability distribution I want to base the bot on for instance). Further, I began research for a method for the difficult bot.

Week 2 (27.11 - 03.12)
This week I implemented the header files for my medium bot. The code for the logic was not complete yet, so I made sure for the outline of the bot to be good. Further, I rsearched a method for my difficult bot: Q-learning. I spent a lot of time on understanding the theory and taking notes.

Week 3 (04.12 - 10.12)
I spent this more time this week researching methods for the hardbot, as I was very undecided. Further, I spent time on looking over other parts of the project in order to gain more understanding.

Week 4 (11.12 - 17.12)
This week I focused on finishing up the medium bot. Not all functions I needed had been implemented yet, so I write out omst of it in comments. I also started adding code to the cpp file of my bot. This week I also decided I did not want to do Q-learning, as many aspects were too complicated for the scope of this project.

Week 5 (18.12 - 24.12)
This week I spent a lot of time on reading and understanding the logic aspect of the code. Many things were not working, so I brainstormed with my teammates on how to solve some issues. I also spent time on thinking of a new metod to work ith

Week 6 (25.12 - 31.12)
I was enjoying my christmas break.

Week 7 (01.01 - 07.01)
Still enjoying Christmas break.

Week 8 (08.01 - 14.01)
Cenzo and I came up with an idea for a bot using reinforcement learning. The idea was to create discrete functions by collecting data that would output probabilities that we raise/ fold. We spent a lot of time in the theory of our idea and started some coding.

Week 9 (15.01 - 21.01)
This week I made small updates to the bot Cenzo and I were working on. I reserched ways to collect data in c++, since we would need that for our bot. I also pinned down many of the details of our method that were unclear.

Week 10 (22.01 - 28.01)
This week I worked on finalising the bot that Cenzo and I had been working on. At this point, the basis of the code was already set up and we moved along to the data collection process. This tunred out to be more complicated than anticipated. I decided to take our idea further and create a logistic regression model.

Week 11 (29.01 - 31.01)
This week I finished up the regression model as best I could and finished my medium bot.
