Week 1  (20/11 -26/11)
Learning to merge a branch
Researched an option to implement a bot, using Monte-Carlo simulations to find an approximate of the winning rate, then making an optimal bet using Kelly's criterion having that approximate winning rate. Quite a solid play, but it does not take into account other players behaviour.

Week 2 (27/11 - 4/12)
 Added implementations for basic functionalities of the player class (in the logic branch). Commented code, added a file for documenting how we implement some aspects of the project (data attributes used, so that other people can start working on their part).
 Commented some code, rewrote the suit attribute of the Card class (to make everything more readable and easier to work with).
 Reimplemented some of the functions of the card class using this new attribute, integrated the changes on the Deck class. Added code lines for testing our methods in the main.cpp
 Had quite an adventure making the code run on VS code.
