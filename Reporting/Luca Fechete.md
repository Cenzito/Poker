## Luca Andrei Fechete - Server Team

### Week 1:

This week, significant progress was made on the server component of our project. My efforts were primarily focused on two key areas:

1. Structural Development Using CMake: I successfully established the foundational structure of our project in the 'server' branch using CMake. This involved configuring CMakeLists.txt to ensure proper organization and modularization of the codebase, which is crucial for the project's scalability and maintainability.

2. Implementation of Basic Server Functionality: Leveraging the POCO C++ Libraries, I developed a basic server capable of handling client-to-client message transmission. This server is designed to efficiently process incoming requests from one client and relay these messages to another, demonstrating the fundamental networking capabilities that our project requires. This implementation showcases the potential of the POCO libraries in facilitating network programming and real-time communication.

For further reference and to aid in understanding the methodologies employed, the following resources can be consulted:
- POCO Libraries Repository: [POCO GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pocoproject/poco)
- POCO Documentation: [POCO Documentation](https://pocoproject.org/docs/)

These resources offer comprehensive information on the POCO library, including its modules, usage examples, and API documentation. They are instrumental for anyone looking to understand the underlying mechanics of our server's functionality.
